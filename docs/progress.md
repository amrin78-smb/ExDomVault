## Decisions log

- 2026-10-22 — **Neon linked**: project `ExDomVault` (`flat-sound-26073660`), branch `production`, via `neon init` + `neon deploy` (no policy changes). Credentials in git-ignored `.env.local`.
- 2026-10-22 — **DB driver: `pg` (node-postgres) + Drizzle through Cloudflare Hyperdrive**, per Neon's agent-skill guidance and Cloudflare's Neon guide. Hyperdrive's origin is Neon's direct endpoint; the Worker opens one client per request. `@neondatabase/serverless` not used.
- 2026-10-22 — Local dev reaches Neon through the Hyperdrive binding's local connection string (`DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` → `CLOUDFLARE_HYPERDRIVE_LOCAL_CONNECTION_STRING_HYPERDRIVE`, set in `vite.config.ts`).
- 2026-10-22 — Neon tooling (`neon` CLI global; `@neon/config`, `@neon/env` as root devDependencies). `neon.ts` holds the branch policy (non-default branches expire after 7 days).
- 2026-10-22 — **npm workspaces** chosen as the single package manager (pnpm not installed; npm 11 available).
- 2026-10-22 — **Hono** for Worker API routing: small, Workers-native, typed context, easy to test via `app.request()`.
- 2026-10-22 — SPA and API live in one Worker (`apps/web`): `src/` = UI, `worker/` = API. Matches Cloudflare's React + Vite template; responsibilities stay in separate directories.
- 2026-10-22 — TypeScript pinned to `~6.0` (typescript-eslint 8.72 supports `<6.1`; TS 7 not yet supported).
- 2026-10-22 — API tests run the Hono app in Node (Vitest) rather than in workerd; revisit `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` in M2 when bindings (Hyperdrive) exist.
- 2026-10-22 — Client-supplied `X-Request-Id` is ignored; the server always generates the request ID.
- 2026-10-22 — npm 11 blocks install scripts by default; `esbuild` and `workerd` are explicitly allowed in root `package.json` `allowScripts`.
- 2026-10-22 — Deploy target is Cloudflare Workers; `netlify.toml` from the design layout is not used.
- 2026-10-22 — Resolved findings that recur are reopened (same fingerprint) with a status-history entry `reason = recurrence`.

## Operator actions required

_Things only the owner can do (Cloudflare account, Neon project, Access app, secrets). Add exact steps as they arise._

- [x] ~~Install Python venv support on the scan host~~ — done 2026-10-22; `npm run worker:install` / `worker:lint` / `worker:test` verified locally (18 pass).
- [ ] Before first production deploy: create a least-privilege Neon role and the Hyperdrive config, then replace the placeholder Hyperdrive id — exact steps in `docs/deployment.md`.
- [ ] Before Milestone 5/6 on the scan host: `sudo apt install -y nmap` (Claude will ask before doing anything that changes the machine).

## Known limitations

- Database connectivity works (health `database: ok`), but there is no schema yet and no authentication — health reports `degraded` until auth exists.
- Local dev connects as the Neon owner role (`neondb_owner`); a least-privilege app role is required before production.
- Overview panels show empty states; other sections are placeholders naming their milestone.
- No deploy workflow; nothing has been deployed.

## Session log

_Per milestone: files changed, checks run (with real results), limitations, next step._

### Milestone 1 — 2026-10-22

**Built:** npm-workspace monorepo; React/Vite/Tailwind SPA with persistent navigation, Overview dashboard (honest empty states, optional labelled dev fixtures stripped from prod), placeholder sections, API status indicator; Cloudflare Worker API (Hono) with request IDs, JSON logging, security headers, fail-closed config, standard error envelope and typed `GET /api/v1/health`; `packages/shared` zod contracts; Python worker skeleton with validated config; ESLint/Prettier/tsc/Vitest/ruff/pytest; GitHub Actions CI; README, `docs/architecture.md`, CLAUDE.md commands.

**Checks (all run locally):**

- `npm run lint` — pass
- `npm run typecheck` — pass
- `npm test` — 7 files, 22 tests pass
- `npm run build` — pass (fixture data confirmed absent from production JS)
- `npm run dev` — verified in workerd: `/api/v1/health` 200 with headers, unknown API path → 404 envelope, `/domains` serves SPA; UI checked in a browser
- Worker: `ruff check`, `ruff format --check`, `pytest` (18 pass) — run in a scratch venv bootstrapped without `python3-venv`; `npm run worker:install` itself not runnable here yet
- CI — first run happens on this push

### Neon wiring — 2026-10-22

**Changed:** `neon init`/`neon deploy` linked the repo (`.neon`, `neon.ts`, `.env.local`); new `packages/database` (`connect()`, `pingDatabase()` with `pg` + Drizzle); `HYPERDRIVE` binding (placeholder id) in `wrangler.jsonc`; `vite.config.ts` feeds the local Hyperdrive connection string from `.env.local`; health route pings the DB; `docs/deployment.md`.

**Checks:** lint pass · typecheck pass · 27 tests pass · build pass (no DB code in browser bundle) · dev server: `/api/v1/health` → `"database":"ok"` (~300 ms per ping to Neon) · with a deliberately wrong password → `"database":"down"`, Neon's auth error only in server logs.

**Next:** Milestone 2 — database and authentication (`docs/prompts/02-database-and-auth.md`).
